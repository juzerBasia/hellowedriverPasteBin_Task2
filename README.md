## What should be done
For this task, please, use:
- the Selenium WebDriver power, 
- framework unit test, and 
- Page Object concepts. 

### Automate the following script:
1. Open https://pastebin.com/ or a similar service in any browser.
 

2. Create 'New Paste' with the following attributes:
    * Code:
      git config --global user.name  "New Sheriff in Town"
      git reset $(git commit-tree HEAD^{tree} -m "Legacy code")
      git push origin master --force
    * Syntax Highlighting: "Bash"
    * Paste Expiration: "10 Minutes"
    * Paste Name / Title: "how to gain dominance among developers"

   
3. Save 'paste' and check the following:
    * Browser page title matches 'Paste Name / Title'
    * Syntax is suspended for bash
    * Check that the code matches the one from paragraph 2.

## IMPORTANT
Pastebin was not happy with the code submitted and after some time got this wonderful screen

<img width="220" src="Pastebin_not_happpy.PNG">

Code was commented out for the purpose of preparing test file

```java
\*private final String code = "git config --global user.name  New Sheriff in Town\"\n" +
                "git reset $(git commit-tree HEAD^{tree} -m Legacy code)\n" +
                "git push origin master --force\n";*\
```  

I completed my file with following code
```java
private final String code = "xff\n" +
            "ffffdfgrtg\n" +
            "cdfv";
``` 

***Good luck!***
